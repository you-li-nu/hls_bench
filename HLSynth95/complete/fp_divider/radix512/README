                       above.

test_vectors.doc    :  This file contains the description of the testing scheme

cmd.inc             :  This is a command file used by the SYNOPSYS simulator 

makefile            :  This is a makefile file to compile the VHDL model.

******************************************************************************

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE SYNOPSYS SIMULATOR:

******************************************************************************

 For example, let us try to run the test vectors on the model contained in
 file "radix512.vhdl". This is a model of the whole chip.

 -  Compile the VHDL package by typing 
    " make "

 -  Run the simulation typing 
    " vhdlsim -t ns -i cmd.inc E ".
         
 The simulation output will appear in a file called "run.out".  If there 
 are any errors in simulation, "Assert" statements will appear in this 
 file, mentioning the port at which the error occurred and the expected 
 value.
