Radix-512 Divider Benchmark

Test Vectors Creation Package (make_test, make_tv)
==================================================



make_tv
-------

C-program to generate a VHDL file, suitable for Synopsys simulator,
from a configuration file, to test the functionality of the Radix-512 
divider benchmark.

This configuration file must have the following keywords:

start		: generates the header of the VHDL file

end		: generates the tail of the VHDL file

dec <x> <d>	: generate one test vector with values x for the dividend
		  and d for the divisor. <x> and <d> must be decimal values.

bin <s1> <s2>	: generate one test vector with binary values s1 for the 
		  dividend and s2 for the divisor. <s1> and <s2> must be
		  strings of '0' and '1' up to 53 characters.

The 'start' instruction must always precede all 'dec' or/and 'bin' 
instructions. The 'end' instruction must close the stream flow.

Optional:

delay <value>	: set the simulation delay to <value>. Default is 10 ns.
		  delay instruction, if present, must appear before start
		  instruction.

All lines starting with '-' as first character are considered comments.

Example:

--  VHDL test vector generator file

delay 20

start

dec 0.750000 0.875000

bin 100000000000000000000 111111111111111111111111111111111

end





make_test
---------

This is simply a c-shell script to better handle files: to avoid undesired
over-write of a file, to generate the output file with same name, but 
different suffix, from the input file.....
