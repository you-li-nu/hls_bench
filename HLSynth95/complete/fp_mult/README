THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

FP_mult.doc         :  This file contains a brief description of the Floating
                       Point Multiplier.

FP_mult.vhd         :  This is the main control file of the Floating Point
                       Multiplier that models its behavior.

m_b2vhdl            :  This is the executable file produced upon compiling
                       mtrans.c. It translates "bit_format" vectors into VHDL. 

test.doc            :  This file contains a brief description of the testing
                       strategy used in simulating the Floating Point 
		       Multiplier. 

test.vhd            :  This file contains the VHDL (translated) test vectors
                       for the Floating Point Multiplier model.  
		       In order to simulate it on the Synopsys (Version 3.0a-
	               10052) simulator, the model(FP_mult.vhd) is instantiated 
                       in this file as a component. The test vectors are 
                       sequence of statements, in a process block, assert 
                       test vectors to the floating point multiplier unit.

mtrans.c            :  This is a C program that will translate test vectors
                       from "bit_format" to VHDL.

tvector.bits        :  This file contains "bit_format" test vectors for the
                       Floating Point Multiplier model.

******************************************************************************

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE SYNOPSYS SIMULATOR:
 Synopsys Version 3.0a

******************************************************************************

 **** Running test_vectors on the Floating Point Multiplier ****

  To simulate the Floating Point Multiplier model:

    (i) Compile the FP_mult.vhd file by typing
          "vhdlan FP_mult.vhd"

    (ii) If the tvector.bits file is not up to date, type
           "m_b2vhdl tvector.bits test.vhd", where test.vhd will be the
            translated VHDL file 

    (iii) Compile the test.vhd file by typing
            "vhdlan test.vhd"

    (iv) Simulate the process using Synopsys debugger typing
           "vhdldbx ATEST__TEST1"
