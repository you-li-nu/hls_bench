This benchmark describes a chip used for monitoring heart-rate in ECG
applications. Its called the QRS chip, since it detects some points called
Q-R-S points in the ECG data stream. Three different descriptions of the
same chip are given, one algorithmic, one in hte form of a state machine,
and another simply called the system description. The authors claim that the
same functionality is expressed by all three descriotions, and this has been
confirmed after extensive simulation. However, there is no english or other
hi-level description of what exactly that functionality is. It is obviously
quite a computation-intensive algorithm, as is evident form the VHDL code. 
Some suitable hi-level description, in English for instance, is necessary.

For simulation, they have included a stimulation file as well as two files
with input data. A file that contains the correct expected output is also
included. However, instructions on how to compare the obtained output of
simulation and the expected output are not included. The output file that I
obtained from running the simulator has less  than 5000 lines, while the
reference file contains about 8,500 lines.
