README file for Answering Machine design example. 

Author: Preeti Ranjan Panda (ppanda@ics.uci.edu)


Description
-----------

This directory contains the Answering Machine design example. The model
is in the SpecCharts language (from which a VHDL model can be automatically
generated). The testbench is written in VHDL. This instantiates the VHDL
model generated from 'ans.sc'.

The contents of this directory are:

ans.sc		- SpecCharts model for Answering Machine

ans.vhdl	- VHDL model generated by SpecCharts from ans.sc

ans_sim.vhdl	- VHDL testbench for generated VHDL model
