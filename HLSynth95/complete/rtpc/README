HOW TO RUN THE TESTING SYSTEM ON SYNOPSYS-SIMULATOR:
======================================================

	(i)	If the make-utility is available you can compile
		the Pre-defined package file and the VHDL-models
		simply by giving the command:
			"make"
		Then go to step (iii). If the make-utility is not
		available you should compile the packages as step
		(ii) explains.

	(ii)	Compile the Pre-defined package file and
		the VHDL models by typing 
			"vhdlan lib.vhd"
			"vhdlan control.vhd"
			"vhdlan rtpc.vhd"
			"vhdlan memory.vhd"
			"vhdlan system.vhd"

	(iii)	Compile the RTPC-assembler by typing
			"cc -o rasm rasm.c"

	(iv)	Choose a program to run on the model, lets say
		"validate.asm". You assemble the file to the
		"program"-file by typing
			"rasm validate.asm"

	(v)	Run the simulation by typing 
			"vhdlsim -i cmd.inc system_cfg".
         
The simulation output will appear in the "dump.*"-files.
If there are any errors in simulation, "Assert" statements 
will appear in "dump.asserts", mentioning the error.
