This directory contains the design files for the BARCODE chip.

The barcode chip is part of a circuit for reading barcodes
at shops. 

A description of the files included in this directory follows.

- "pseudo_code"
	a file that contains the description of the barcode algorithm in
	pseudo-code. Note that this pseudo-code was not developed from the
	hi-level specification of the barcode algorithm, but was extracted from
	the VHDL source for readibilty. The closeness of the description to the
	specification can only be determined after acquiring the specification,
	which is for some reason not included.

- "barcode.vhdl"
	contains the vhdl description of the function of the 
	chip.

- "barcode_stim.vhdl"
	contains the vhdl description needed for (partial)
	simulation of the design.

- "barcode.io"
	this file is a more english like description of
	the inputs and the way the outputs change with
	the inputs. A ".I" indicates an input and a ".O"
	indicates an output. It should be noted that in
	several places one has been asked "to iterate 
	till ..." . Given the VHDL description without
	any IO constraints, one will come up with schedules
	which needs different number of clock ticks (time
	steps) to do the same sequence of operations. We have 
	tried to impose the minimum amount of constraint by
	asking "to iterate till ...". We suggest one go
	through their implementation of the schedule till
	the outputs reach the values specified. If the
	specified values are not reached, there is a bug
	somewhere.

Additional information about this benchmark and a new data point at
register-, gate- and transistor-level for this design can be obtained from
