THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

adder.doc           :  This file contains a brief description of the Floating
                       Point Adder/Subtractor.

adder.vhd           :  This is the main control file of the Floating Point
                       Adder/Subtractor that models its behavior.

test.doc            :  This file contains a brief description of the testing
                       strategy used in simulating the Floating Point 
		       Adder/Subtractor.

test.vhd            :  This file contains the VHDL (translated) test vectors
                       for the Floating Point Adder/Subtractor model.  
		       In order to simulate it on the Synopsys ( Version 3.0) 
		       simulator, the model is instantiated in this file as a 
		       component. The test vectors are statements inside a 
		       VHDL process.

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE SYNOPSYS SIMULATOR: 

******************************************************************************

 **** Running test_vectors on the Floating Point Adder/Subtractor ****

  To simulate the Floating Point Adder/Subtractor model:

    (i) Compile the adder.vhd file by typing
          "vhdlan adder.vhd"

    (ii) Compile the test.vhd file by typing
            "vhdlan test.vhd"

    (iv) Simulate the process by typing
           "vhdldbx ATEST__TEST1"

         If there are any errors in simulation, "Assert" statements
         will appear in this file, mentioning the port at which the
         error occurred and the expected value.  The one valid "Assert"
         statement expected in the testing process is "Precision lost",
         which occurs when the result is inaccurate because one operand
         has a significantly larger exponent than the other
