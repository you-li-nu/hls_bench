THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :


prawn.doc           :  This file contains a brief description of the
                       Prawn CPU, and the testing strategy for the VHDL model.

cpu.vhdl            :  This file contains VHDL model of Prawn CPU.

types.vhdl          :  This file contains some VHDL types and functions 
                       used in the models. These are the public domain MVL7
                       functions.

MVL7_functions.vhdl :  This file contains some VHDL functions used in the
		       models. 

lib.vhdl            :  This file contains some VHDL constants, subtypes,
                       and functions used in the models.

tst*.vhdl           :  These files contain the VHDL (translated) test vectors
		       for the models of Prawn.  The test vectors are
		       contents of memory inside a VHDL process.

mem.vhdl            :  This file is a copy of one of "tst*.vhdl" files
		       used in current simulation. 

sim.vhdl	    :  In order to simulate Prawn CPU on any simulator, the
		       CPU model and memory model for test are instantiated
		       in this file as a component.

cmd.i               :  This is a command file used by the ZYCAD simulator 
                       ( Version 1.0a) while running the test vectors on any of
                       the models.

Makefile            :  This file contains the command for "make" command
                       which is used to execute the analysis and simulation
		       with the ZYCAD VHDL Simulator. (You can substitute
		       your own VHDL simulator's respective compilation 
		       commands.)
             

******************************************************************************

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE ZYCAD SIMULATOR:

******************************************************************************

 **** Running whole set of test_vectors on the Prawn CPU ****

 If you do not make your own test vectors, start from 3)

1) Make your memory model file "tst*.vhdl" 

2) Edit Makefile to add the code for "tst*.vhdl" which you made.

3) "make"

4) The simulation results will be moved in a file called "tst*.rst", if you
   edit Makefile correctly. If there is no error, "Assert" statements will
   appear in this file with ERROR level, mentioning the simulation is done
   successfully. If there are any errors, "Assert" statements will appear
   in this file with FAILURE level and/or NOTE level, mentioning which
   check point found the error.
