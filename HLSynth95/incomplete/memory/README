Description
-----------
The design examples included in this directory are all C-programs
that have interesting memory access patterns - which makes them
useful test cases for memory synthesis algorithms.

The contents of this directory are:

Compress.c	- Image compression

GSR.c           - Gauss-Seidel Relaxation

Laplace.c       - Laplace edge enhancement algorithm

Linear.c        - Linear recurrence solver

LowPass.c	- Low pass filter

README		- This file

SOR.c		- Successive Over-Relaxation

Wavelet.c	- Debaucles 4-Coefficient Wavelet filter
