  High Level Synthesis Benchmarks, 1991.

  Benchmark coordinator, Robert Mayo (mayo@decwrl.dec.com)
  MCNC site coordinator, Jeri Williams (benchmarks@mcnc.org)
  MCNC files prepared by: Douglas Maltais.

  The 1991 High Level Synthesis Workshop Benchmarks were originally
  copied to the MCNC file distribution center during October of 1990.
  The files contained in the 1991 set include all of the benchmarks of
  the 1989 set, plus new files from Giovanni De Micheli of Stanford U.
  This benchmark set is available through MCNC's public ftp access system.

  The files are also available from the original site via automatic e-mail.
  This is generally a slower method of transferring files. To request one or
  more files from DEC, rather than MCNC, send e-mail to ``hlsw@decwrl.dec.com''.
  The body of the letter should contain one or more lines of the form:

    Request: <files>

  where <files> is a blank separated list of desired files.  Unix(tm)
  wild card characters may be used.  Request the file ``welcome'' for
  more details.

  A mailing list of people interested in the High Level Synthesis
  is being maintained.  To send to these people, use the address
  ``hlsw-people@decwrl.dec.com''.  To be added or deleted from this
  mailing list, send to ``hlsw-request@decwrl.dec.com''.
