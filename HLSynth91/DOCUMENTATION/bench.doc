BENCHMARK DOCUMENTATION, as of July 30, 1990

    Below is a list of the benchmarks for the 1991 High-Level Synthesis 
    Workshop.  Robert Mayo is still maintaining the clearinghouse system,
    but due to time constraints is not participating in the selection of
    the benchmarks.

    The current benchmarks come from two sources.  The first set is from the 
    1989 workshop.  The second set comes from Giovanni De Micheli at Stanford.

    The 1989 workshop benchmarks are:

	Processors:
	    mc6502 (ISP description)
	    mc68000 (ISP description)

	Peripheral/glue chips:
	    i8251 (ISP description, Hardware C description)
	    Amiga BLIT chip (C description)

	DSP chips:
	    fft (paper description only)
	    pitch extraction (paper description only)
	    kalman filter (ISP description)

	Small examples:
	    Traffic light controller (V & VHDL descriptions)
	    GCD (V & VHDL descriptions)
	    Counter (V & VHDL descriptions)
	    Prefetch (V & VHDL descriptions)

    The Stanford benchmark set includes:

	daio_receiver		DAIO Receiver
	daio_phase_decoder	DAIO Phase Decoder
	diffeq			Differential Equation Solver
	ecc			Error Correction System
	elliptic		Fifth Order Elliptic Filter
	frisc			RISC Microprocessor
	gcd			Greatest Common Divisor Alg.
	parker1986		Example from Alice Parker 1986
	traffic			Traffic Light Controller
	tseng			Example from Tseng
