Pitch extractor for speech coding -- as of 6/27/88

Algorithm: 
    Described in R.J.Sluyter, H.J.Kotmans, A.v.Leeuwaarden,
    "A novel method for pitch extraction from speech and a hardware model
    applicable to vocoder systems", Proc. IEEE ICASSP (Int'l Conference on
    Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing), Denver CO, 1980.  We propose 
    to leave out the preceeding FFT.  Only the pitch extraction itself should 
    be designed.

Word-lengths: 
    As described in the paper.

Sample rate: 
    8 KHz (as in the paper).  Also a second design working for high-
    quality speech at 32 KHz (which is hypothetical of course) could be entered 
    too in order to evaluate how flexible the synthesis systems respond 
    to sample rate changes.
