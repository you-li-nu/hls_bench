BENCHMARK DOCUMENTATION, as of March 16, 1989

    Below is a list of the benchmarks for the 1989 High-Level Synthesis 
    Workshop.  I encourage comments on the benchmarks, and hope that 
    participants will be able to run most of these benchmarks to provide 
    comparisons with other systems.

    The benchmarks are currently being developed, and will change over
    time.  Bruce Irvin is currently converting some of them to VHDL.

    The benchmarks are:

	Processors:
	    mc6502 (ISP description)
	    mc68000 (ISP description)

	Peripheral/glue chips:
	    i8251 (ISP description, Hardware C description)
	    Amiga BLIT chip (C description)

	DSP chips:
	    fft (paper description only)
	    pitch extraction (paper description only)
	    kalman filter (ISP description)

	Small examples:
	    Traffic light controller (V & VHDL descriptions)
	    GCD (V & VHDL descriptions)
	    Counter (V & VHDL descriptions)
	    Prefetch (V & VHDL descriptions)
