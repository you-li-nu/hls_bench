Testing Strategy :

1. We start of by initializing all the inputs to zero.

-- Pattern #0
Xinport <= 0;
Yinport <= 0;
Uinport <= 0;
DXport <= 0;
Aport <= 0;

2. We check if the loop executes the desired number of times and provides the
   right values for Y and U.

-- Pattern #1

Xinport <= 2;
Yinport <= 2;
Uinport <= 1;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 5;



3. We check if there is a overflow problem if the initial value of Y is large.

-- Pattern #2
Xinport <= 2;
Yinport <= 12;
Uinport <= 2;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 5;


4. Check if Y and U change when X and Y start off with zero values.

-- Pattern # 3

Xinport <= 0;
Yinport <= 0;
Uinport <= 1;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 4;


5. How does the circuit behave if DX is increased ?

-- Pattern # 4

Xinport <= 0;
Yinport <= 0;
Uinport <= 1;
DXport <= 2;
Aport <= 4;

6. Check if increasing the number of loop iterations causes overflow. 

-- Pattern # 5

Xinport <= 0;
Yinport <= 0;
Uinport <= 1;
DXport <= 2;
Aport <= 8;


7. Check circuit behavior of X is large, and if it ever goes into the loop.

-- Pattern # 6

Xinport <= 20;
Yinport <= 0;
Uinport <= 1;
DXport <= -2;
Aport <= 8;


8. What happens when initial value of Y is large ? 

-- Pattern # 7

Xinport <= 1;
Yinport <= 32;
Uinport <= 10;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 4;


9. What happens when U starts off with a zero ? 


-- Pattern # 8

Xinport <= 1;
Yinport <= 1;
Uinport <= 0;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 4;



10. What happens when X and U start off with a zero ? 

-- Pattern # 9

Xinport <= 0;
Yinport <= 1;
Uinport <= 0;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 4;


11. How does the behavioir change when U starts off being negative? 

-- Pattern # 10

Xinport <= 0;
Yinport <= 1;
Uinport <= -2;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 4;


12. Is there a problem if X and Y start off as zero and U starts off 
    on the negative ? 

-- Pattern # 11

Xinport <= 0;
Yinport <= 0;
Uinport <= -2;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 4;

13. What happens when X , Y and U start off with negative values? 

-- Pattern # 12

Xinport <= -4;
Yinport <= -1;
Uinport <= -2;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 0;


Pattern 13 to Pattern 56 contain some sanity checks. We start off by setting 

Xinport <= 1;
Yinport <= 0;
Uinport <= -2;
DXport <= 1;
Aport <= 0;
