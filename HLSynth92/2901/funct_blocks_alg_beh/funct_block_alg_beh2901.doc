THE Functional Block MODEL

 The chip has been partitioned into functional blocks which are 
 modeled by VHDL alogorithmic Behaviour

 The blocks are :

** alu_inputs : ALU source selector

** alu : ALU

** mem : RAM 

** Q_reg : Q register 

** output_and_shifter : output selector and the shifter outputs from RAM and
                          Q-register.

Guarded concurrent blocks "Q_reg" and "mem" are used to represent the 
sequential elements in the chip. These blocks are trigerred by the clock.
Both the guarded blocks have a master-slave configuration.

VARIABLES, SIGNALS AND TYPES :

File "am2901.doc" contains a general description of the chip and its ports.

This model uses the following global and local signals and variables:

   *******************************************************

  GLOBAL SIGNALS :

  RAM ==> The 16-word by 4-bit RAM.

  RE ==> Input data for ALU, selected by ALU data selector. ( 4 bits)

  S ==> Input data for ALU, selected by ALU data selector. ( 4 bits)

  A ==> The RAM word addressed by Aadd is read into this variable. ( 4 bits)

  B ==> The RAM word addressed by Badd is read into this variable. ( 4 bits)

  Q ==> Used to represent the slave in the Q register. ( 4 bits)

  F ==> ALU output . ( 4 bits)

   *******************************************************

 LOCAL SIGNALS (in VHDL concurrent blocks) :

   ## IN BLOCK "alu" :

  R_ext ==> Extended input data for ALU. This consists of "RE" 
             concatenated with a '0' bit at the MSB position.
             This extended ALU input is used to facilitate 
             computation of carry bit "C4". ( 5 bits)
             ( R_ext := '0' & RE; )

  S_ext ==> Extended input data for ALU. This consists of "S" 
             concatenated with a '0' bit at the MSB position.
             This extended ALU input is used to facilitate
             computation of carry bit "C4". ( 5 bits)
             ( R_ext := '0' & S; )
              
  result ==> Extended output from ALU. ( 5 bits)
              ( "F" is obtained from "result".
                 F <= result(3 downto 0); )
             
  temp_p ==> An intermediate variable, calculated from "result" and used in the
         computation of propagate term "Pbar". ( 5 bits)

  temp_g ==> An intermediate variable, calculated from "result" and used in the
         computation of generate term "Gbar". ( 5 bits)
