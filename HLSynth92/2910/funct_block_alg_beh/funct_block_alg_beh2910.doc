THE Functional Block MODEL

 The chip has been partitioned into functional blocks which are 
 modeled by VHDL concurrent blocks.

 The blocks are :

 ** muxr : Multiplexer that selects data output and tri-state-driver.

 ** reg_ctr : Register/Counter

 ** PC : Microprogram Counter

 ** stack_and_sp : Stack and stack pointer

 ** ctrl : Control Logic

Guarded concurrent blocks "reg_ctr", "PC" and "stack_and_sp" are used to
represent the sequential elements in the chip. These blocks are trigerred
by the rising edge of clock.

VARIABLES AND SIGNALS :

File "am2910.doc" contains a general description of the chip and its ports.

This model uses the following global and local signals and variables:

   *******************************************************

  GLOBAL SIGNALS :

         sp : stack pointer

   reg_file : register file for stack

       push : push signal for stack

        pop : pop signal for stack

      clear : clear signal for stack pointer and microprogram counter

        uPC : microprogram counter

         RE : register/counter

       decr : decrement signal for register/counter

       load : load signal for register/counter

  Rzero_bar : zero detector output (corresponding to register/counter)

      R_sel : Register/counter select signal to multiplexer

      D_sel : Direct data input select signal to multiplexer  

    uPC_sel : Microprogram counter select signal to multiplexer

  stack_sel : Top-of-stack select signal to multiplexer

     Y_temp : Selected output from multiplexer and input to 
	      tri-state-driver.

   *******************************************************

 LOCAL SIGNALS (in VHDL concurrent blocks) :

   ## IN BLOCK "ctrl" :

   fail :  Temporary signal used in the evaluation of condition code.
