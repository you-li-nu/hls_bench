 The "stack_and_sp" block includes the stack register file and the stack
 pointer.

 In testing this block, we do five successive PUSHes and then, five 
 successive POPs, to test all locations of the register file. We use
 two sets of such vectors to test for stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 faults.

 The signal FULL_BAR is also tested to see if the stack is full.
