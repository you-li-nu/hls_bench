 This is a behavioral or algorithmic model of the Am2910, in which it is 
modeled as a single VHDL process, without any partitioning into smaller 
blocks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

VARIABLES :

File "am2910.doc" contains a general description of the chip and its ports.

This model uses the following types and variables:

   *******************************************************

  VARIABLES :

  FAIL ==> Temporary variable used in evaluation of condition code.
  SP ==> Variable to represent stack pointer.
  STACK ==> Variable to represent stack register file (5-word by 12-bit).
  RE ==> Variable to represent register/counter
  uPC ==> Variable to represent microprogram counter
  Y_temp ==> Temporary variable used to represent mux output and 
	     tri-state driver input.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF MODEL :

 The VHDL process is trigerred by a falling clock edge.
