THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

( NOTE: These files, especially the test vectors, pertain to both
        sub-directories mentioned below. )

am2910.doc          :  This file contains a brief description of the Am2910
                       chip.

am2910.ps           :  This is a postscript file containing the block diagram 
                       of Am2910

MVL7_functions.vhd  :  This file contains some VHDL functions used in the
		       models.

types.vhd           :  This file contains the public domain MVL7 functions

synthesis_types.vhd :  This file contains some VHDL data types used in the
		       models, to facilitate synthesis.

test_vectors.bits   :  This file contains "bit_format" test vectors for the
                       models of Am2901. 

trans.c             :  This is a C program that will translate test vectors
                       from "bit_format" to VHDL.

test_vectors_2910.vhdl : This file contains the VHDL (translated) test vectors
  		       for the models of Am2910. In order to simulate it on
		       the Zycad ( Version 1.0a) simulator, the model is
		       instantiated in this file as a component. The test
		       vectors are statements inside a VHDL process.

test_vectors.doc    :  This is a documentation files on the test vectors,

cmd.inc             :  This is a command file used by the ZYCAD simulator 
                       ( Version 1.0a) while running the test vectors on any of
                       the models.
             
THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING SUB-DIRECTORIES :

alg_beh             :  This contains the file in which the Am2910 is modeled as
                       a single VHDL process.

funct_block_alg_beh :  This contains the file in which the Am2910 is partitioned
                       into functional blocks and the blocks are modeled using 
                       their algorithmic behaviour.

******************************************************************************

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE ZYCAD SIMULATOR:

******************************************************************************

 **** Running test_vectors on the whole chip ****

 For example, let us try to run the test vectors on the model contained in
 file "funct_block_alg_beh/funct_block_alg_beh2910.vhdl". This is a model of the whole chip.
							
     (i) Compile the MVL7 public domain VHDL functions file by typing 
          " zvan types.vhd"

    (ii) Compile the VHDL functions file by typing 
          " zvan MVL4_functions.vhd"

   (iii) Compile the VHDL types file by typing 
          " zvan synthesis_types.vhd"

    (iv) Compile the VHDL model file by typing 
          " zvan funct_block_alg_beh2910.vhdl"

     (v) Compile the VHDL test-vectors file by typing 
          " zvan test_vectors.vhdl"

    (vi) Compile the VHDL test-vectors file by typing 
           " zvsim -t ns -i cmd.inc E".
         
         The simulation output will appear in a file called "run.out".
         If there are any errors in simulation, "Assert" statements 
	 will appear in this file, mentioning the port at which the 
	 error occurred and the expected value.
