The behavior of the elliptic filter can be tested by applying 
a set of test patterns that are fairly sufficient to perform
a "sanity check" on the various operators of the filter. In
case of digital filters, any input (along with a set of current
state vectors) will exercise all the operations of the filter
(since there are no conditional branches in the design). However,
a few different test patterns will exercise the design more 
thoroughly, and we have presented in the file "test_vectors.vhdl"
a handful of such test vectors. The vectors were derived heuristically,
according to standard practices used in such cases. We consider
vectors that are all similar (say all 0's and all 1's), vectors that
have different combinations of even and odd numbers as current state 
vectors, and vectors that are powers of 2.        

The functional testing of the elliptic filter is usually done
witha  'delta' function, the rough approximation of which in the 
digital domain is a vector that is '1' in the first instance, and is 
'0' for all other states. The corresponding output has to be tested
by substituting the vector in the z-transform of the state equation.
This is represented by Pattern #1, followed by Patterns 2, 3, and 4.
