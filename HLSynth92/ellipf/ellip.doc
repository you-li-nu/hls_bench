The elliptic filter has been used as a benchmark for many architectural
synthesis packages, and is a part of the high-level synthesis benchmark
suite. The elliptic filter belongs to the class of 
Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, because its response to an  
impulse input remains non-zero till infinite time in a theoretical sense.
The particular filter we deal with here is a low pass filter, meaning 
that it filters off frequencies higher than a certain limit, called the 
cut-off frequency.

The elliptic filter is an improved form of the Chebyshev filter, in which
the response function is chosen to be of the form similar to the well 
known elliptic function. This filter distributes the passband ripple
over the passband and the stopband, while retaining the transition
characteristics of the Chebyshev filter. This feature has made elliptic
filters extremely attractive for practical use, although it is
significantly more complicated than the other filters. The Jacobian
Elliptic functions, which define the response of this class of filters
are considered to be solutions of a set of nonlinear, second order 
differential equations, expressed in terms of specially defined 
Jacobian Elliptic sine and cosine functions. A fairly complicated 
procedure as described in [1] can be used to obtain the order of the 
filter and other essential parameters, given the response characteristic 
of the desired filter in terms of the passband ripple, stopband ripple, 
and the transition band width.
