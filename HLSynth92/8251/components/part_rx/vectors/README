 This directory contains files and sub-directories that pertain to testing
 the VHDL model of the 8251.


 The 8251 is a quite complicated chip and required many test vectors to 
 test its functionality. Thus, it was not feasible to put all test vectors 
 in the same file. So, we have grouped the test vectors together into
 different files on the basis of the mode of functionality they are testing.

 THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

rx_ext_sync, 	      : These files contain test-vectors for simulating
rx_int_sync             the SYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE internal and external mode of 
                        the 8251.

rx_async_1            : This file contains test-vectors for simulating
                        the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode using 1x baud rate
                        of the 8251.

rx_async_16x_5,        : These files contain test-vectors for simulating
rx_async_16x_6           the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode using 16x baud rate
rx_async_16x_7           (with 5, 6, 7 and 8 bits per character) of the 8251.
rx_async_16x_8           

rx_async_64x_5,        : These files contain test-vectors for simulating
rx_async_64x_6           the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode using 64x baud rate
rx_async_64x_7           (with 5, 6, 7 and 8 bits per character) of the 8251.
rx_async_64x_8
