 This directory contains instantiated models for the three main constituent
 "VHDL processes" ("main", "receiver" and "transmitter") in our VHDL model of
 the 8251 USART (which is in file "8251.vhd.

 It also contains test vectors for testing those "constituent processes".

 THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING SUB-DIRECTORIES :

 part_main : This sub-directory contains instantiated models and test vectors
	     for the "main" VHDL process in the model of the 8251 USART.

 part_tx   : This sub-directory contains instantiated models and test vectors
             for the "transmitter" VHDL process in the model of the 8251 USART.

 part_rx   : This sub-directory contains instantiated models and test vectors
	     for the "receiver" VHDL process in the model of the 8251 USART.
