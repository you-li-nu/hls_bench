 THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

 8251.vhd 	     : This file contains our VHDL model of the 8251

 8251.doc            : This file contains a description of our VHDL model of
		       the 8251 (which is in file "8251.vhd") and details
		       regarding the function of global signals and local
		       variables used in the model. 

 test_vectors.doc    : This file contains a description of the testing strategy

 MVL7_functions.vhd  :  This file contains some VHDL functions used in the
		        VHDL models (including a resolution function).

 types.vhd           :  This file contains some MVL7 public domain types and functions

 synthesis_types.vhd : This file contains some VHDL data types used in the
		       models.

 THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING SUB-DIRECTORIES :

 vectors             : This directory contains test vectors for simulating the
		       VHDL model of the 8251 and related documentation.
                       The test vectors have been split into a number of files
                       to improve the runtimes for compilation and simulation.

 components 	     : This directory contains instantiated models for the
		       three main constituent "VHDL processes" ("main", 
		       "receiver" and "transmitter") in our VHDL model of the
		       8251 USART (which is in file "8251.vhd").
		       It also contains test vectors for testing those
		       "constituent processes".

  Procedure to Simulate the model on one test vector set
----------------------------------------------------------

 (1) Compile the MVL7 data types file :
				          zvan types.vhd

 (2) Compile the VHDL data types file :
				          zvan synthesis_types.vhd

 (3) Compile the VHDL data functions file :
				             zvan MVL7_functions.vhd


 (4) Compile the VHDL model file of the 8251 USART:
				       		    zvan 8251.vhd

 (5) Compile the test vector file :
		     		    zvan rx_async_8_1x.vhd

 (6) Simulate the test vectors :
				 zvsim -t ns -i cmd_inc E

     The simulation output appears in a file called "run.out".
     Any simulation errors (outputs not matching expected values) are shown
     by "Assert" statements in the file "run.out".
