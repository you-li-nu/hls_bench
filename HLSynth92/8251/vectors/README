 This directory contains files and sub-directories that pertain to testing
 the VHDL model of the 8251.


 The 8251 is a quite complicated chip and required many test vectors to 
 test its functionality. Thus, it was not feasible to put all test vectors 
 in the same file. So, we have grouped the test vectors together into
 different files on the basis of the mode of functionality they are testing.

 THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

sytx		      : This file contains test-vectors for simulating
        		the SYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION mode of the 8251.

syrx_5, syrx_6	      : These files contains test-vectors for simulating
syrx_7                  the SYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE mode of the 8251 for 5,6,7,8 
                        characters.

rx_async_5_16x_even,  : These files contains test-vectors for simulating
rx_async_5_16x_odd,     the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode (with 5 bits per
rx_async_5_16x_no       character) of the 8251, with even, odd and no 
                        parity using 16x baud rate.

rx_async_5_1x,        : These files contains test-vectors for simulating
rx_async_5_64x_even     the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode (with 5 bits per
                        character) of the 8251, using 1x and 64x baud rate

rx_async_6_1x,        : These files contains test-vectors for simulating
rx_async_6_16x          the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode (with 6 bits per
rx_async_6_64x_even     character) of the 8251, using 1x, 16x and 64x 
                        baud rate

rx_async_7_1x,        : These files contains test-vectors for simulating
rx_async_7_16x          the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode (with 7 bits per
rx_async_7_64x_even     character) of the 8251, using 1x, 16x and 64x 
                        baud rate

rx_async_8_1x,        : These files contains test-vectors for simulating
rx_async_8_16x          the ASYNCHRONOUS RECEIVE Mode (with 8 bits per
rx_async_8_64x_even     character) of the 8251, using 1x, 16x and 64x 
                        baud rate

tx_async_5_1x,	      : This file contains test-vectors for simulating
tx_async_5_16x          the ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION Mode (with 5 bits per
		        character) of the 8251, using 1x and 16x baud rates

tx_async_5_64x_1stop  : This file contains test-vectors for simulating
tx_async_5_16x_1.5stop, the ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION Mode (with 5 bits per
tx_async_5_16x_2stop    character) of the 8251, using 64x baud rate with 1,
                        1.5 and 2 stop bits

tx_async_6_1x,	      : This file contains test-vectors for simulating
tx_async_6_16x          the ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION Mode (with 6 bits per
