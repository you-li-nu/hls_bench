  The testing strategy consists of running a clock process and a 
  counter testing process.

  TEST 1 starts off with simple test of reset, load limit to 2 and count up.
  A check is done so that the counter does not increment when the limit
  is hit, eventhough countup signal is enabled.

  It should not count down either, since we cannot determine the direction 
  of the previous count and from which direction the limit was hit.
  When the limit is changed to 0, counting down from 2 can resume.      

  TEST2 perform some extensive testing of the counter's limit handling.
  The limits is initially set to 13, the counter is cleared and then 
  set to count up. Once the counter hits the limit, the limit is changed
  to 15 and counting is resumed.

  Once the limit of 15 is hit, the limit is changed to 7 and counting down
  is started. When the limit of 7 is reached, the counter stops counting 
  and only when the limit is reset to 0 does counting down resume.
      
  TEST3 tries to perform counting beyond the range, i.e. above 15 and below 0.
  The counter is cleared and the limit set to 7. It is counted up by 1 and counted
  down by 1 two times. In the set count down, the counter wraps around from a 0
  to a 15. Now a count up is down at 15 and the counter again wraps around
  to 0.

  TEST4 completely tests the counting sequence. It counts from 0 all the way to 15.
  It then counts down from 15 to 0.
