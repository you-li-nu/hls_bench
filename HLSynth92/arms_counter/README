THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

( NOTE: These files, especially the test vectors, pertain to all three 
        sub-directories mentioned below. )

ROADMAP 	    :  This file explains the organization of files and 
		       directories in this benchmark example. It also
		       explains the steps to be followed when executing 
		       test vectors on the VHDL models. IT IS RECOMMENDED
		       THAT THIS FILE BE READ BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER.

arms_counter.doc    :  This file contains a brief description of the Armstrong
                       counter.

test_vectors_ARMS_COUNTER.vhdl: This file contains the VHDL (translated) test vectors
		       for ARMS_COUNTER. In order to simulate it on the Zycad 
                       ( Version 1.0a) simulator, the model is
		       instantiated in this file as a component. The test
		       vectors are statements inside a VHDL process.

test_vectors.doc    :  This is a documentation files on the test vectors,

cmd.inc             :  This is a command file used by the ZYCAD simulator 
                       ( Version 1.0a) while running the test vectors on any of
                       the models.

******************************************************************************

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE ZYCAD SIMULATOR:

******************************************************************************

 **** Running test_vectors on the whole chip ****

 For example, let us try to run the test vectors on the model contained in
 file "ARMS_COUNTER.vhdl". This is a model of the whole chip.

 (i) Compile the Pre-defined Functions file by typing 
          " zvan pack_2.0.vhd"
 (ii) Compile the VHDL model file by typing 
          " zvan ARMS_COUNTER.vhdl"
 (iii) Compile the VHDL test-vectors file by typing 
          " zvan test_vectors_ARMS_COUNTER.vhdl"
 (iv)  Run the simulation typing 
           " zvsim -t ns -i cmd.inc E".
         
 The simulation output will appear in a file called "run.out".
 If there are any errors in simulation, "Assert" statements 
 will appear in this file, mentioning the port at which the 
 error occurred and the expected value.
