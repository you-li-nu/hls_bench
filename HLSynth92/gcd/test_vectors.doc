 OVERALL TESTING STRATEGY 

 The test vectors are designed to detect "stuck-at-0" and "stuck-at-1" 
 faults at various points in the hardware. All possible paths in this gcd
 VHDL model are tested. 


 The following types of patterns have been tested

 1. X and Y are small and equal x = 1, y = 1, reset = 0
 2. X and Y are small and divisible x = 2, y = 1, reset = 0
 3. X and Y are small and divisible 2 times x = 6, y = 3, reset = 0
 4. X and Y are small and divisible 4 times x = 12, y = 3, reset = 0
 5. X and Y are small and divisible x = 1, y = 2, reset = 0
 6. X and Y are small and divisible 2 times x = 3, y = 6, reset = 0
 7. X and Y are small and divisible 4 times x = 3, y = 12, reset = 0
 8. X and Y are small and divisible 4 times x = 12, y = 6, reset = 1
 9. X and Y are not divisible x = 28, y = 5, reset = 0
 10. X and Y are not divisible x = 5, y = 28, reset = 0
 11. X and Y are not divisible x = 28, y = 5, reset = 1
 12. X and Y are equal x = 28, y = 28, reset = 0
 13. X and Y are equal x = 28, y = 28, reset = 1
 14. Y is large , x = 3, y = 192, reset = 0
 15. X is large , x = 192, y = 3, reset = 0
 16. X and Y are large, X > Y, and X is not divisible by Y, x = 208, y = 64, reset = 0
 17. X and Y are large, X < Y and Y is not divisible by X, x = 38, y = 158, reset = 0
 18. X and Y are large, X > Y and X is not divisible by X, x = 158, y = 38, reset = 0
 19. X and Y are large, almost equal and are not divisible, x = 158, y = 192, reset = 0
 20. X and Y are large, almost equal and are not divisible, x = 158, y = 192, reset = 1
 21. X = 0, Y is large, x = 0, y = 192, reset = 0
 22. X is large, Y = 0, x = 192, y = 0, reset = 0
 23. X = 0, Y = 0, x = 0, y = 0, reset = 0
 24. X = 0, Y = 0, x = 0, y = 0, reset = 1
