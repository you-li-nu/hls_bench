THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :


gcd.doc             :  This file contains a brief description of the gcd
                       chip.

gcd.vhdl            :  This file contains the VHDL model of gcd in this example.

pack_2.0.vhdl       :  This file contains VHDL functions

test_vectors.vhdl   :  This file contains the VHDL (translated) test vectors
		       for the model of gcd. In order to simulate it on
		       the Zycad ( Version 1.0a) simulator, the model is
		       instantiated in this file as a component. The test
		       vectors are statements inside a VHDL process.


test_vectors.doc    :  This file contains the description of the testing scheme

cmd.inc             :  This is a command file used by the ZYCAD simulator 
                       ( Version 1.0a) while running the test vectors on any of
                       the models.

******************************************************************************

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE ZYCAD SIMULATOR:

******************************************************************************

 **** Running test_vectors on the whole chip ****

 For example, let us try to run the test vectors on the model contained in
 file "GCD.vhdl". This is a model of the whole chip.

   (i) Compile the Pre-defined Functions file by typing 
          " zvan pack_2.0.vhd"
  (ii) Compile the VHDL model file by typing 
          " zvan GCD.vhdl"
 (iii) Compile the VHDL test-vectors file by typing 
         " zvan test_vectors_GCD.vhdl"
 (iv)  Run the simulation typing 
           " zvsim -t ns -i cmd.inc E".
         
  The simulation output will appear in a file called "run.out".
  If there are any errors in simulation, "Assert" statements 
  will appear in this file, mentioning the port at which the 
  error occurred and the expected value.
