This directory contains the design files for the DISPLAY chip.

The DISPLAY chip is a driver for four seven-segment LED displays.
The display units display ten minutes, minutes, ten seconds and
seconds. After reaching 59 59, they reset on the next clock to 
00 00.

A description of the files in this directory follows.

- "gcd.vhdl"
        contains the vhdl description of the function of the
        chip.

- "gcd_stim.vhdl"
        contains the vhdl description needed for 
        simulation of the design.

- "waves.ps"
        contains the waveforms resulting from simulating the
        scheduled vhdl description. When the signal consists
        of a more than one bit, then the value (decimal) is indicated
        between parallel lines whenever possible. The file is
	in postscript.

- "gcd.io"
        this file is a more english like description of
        the inputs and the way the outputs change with
        the inputs. A ".I" indicates an input and a ".O"
        indicates an output. A ".clock 7" implies, the design
	should be clocked 7 times. Note that the
	"WAIT UNTIL clk = '1'; EXIT RESET_LOOP WHEN reset = '1';"
	statement in the VHDL description implements the loop
	in one clock cycle.

Additional information about this benchmark and a new data point at
register-, gate- and transistor-level for this design can be obtained from
