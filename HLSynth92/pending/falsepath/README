This directory contains the design files for the FALSEPATH chip.
The falsepath chip is an address calculation chip. Its has false
paths in the flowgraph level. Refer to Bergamaschi paper [1].

A description of the files in the directory follows.

- "falsepath.vhdl" 
    contains the description of the falsepath example
    as well as a package with data type declarations and a conversion
    function. Though, the VHDL description is based on VHDL standard types
    only, a conversion function from integer to bit_vector must be
    included, since VHDL does not support conversions between the standard
    data types. Thus, it might be necessary to adopt this conversion
    function for a specific synthesis system.

- "falsepath_stim.vhdl"
    contains the simulation environment. The output of the falsepath
    component is automatically checked for correctness.
    
- "waves.ps"
    This postscript file shows the wave forms of the input and output
    signals obtained by the VHDL simulator.

- "falsepath.io"
        this file is a more english like description of
        the inputs and the way the outputs change with
        the inputs. A ".I" indicates an input and a ".O"
        indicates an output. 

Additional information about this benchmark and a new data point at
register-, gate- and transistor-level for this design can be obtained from
