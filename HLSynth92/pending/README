====================== file: HLSynth92/pending/README =======================

This directory contains 7 new design benchmarks, submitted for addition to
the HLSynth92 benchmark set. These are placed in the following sub-
directories :

      barcode/        falsepath/      gcd_alt/            qrs/
      display/          fancy/        highway/ 

These benchmarks are being reviewed and simulated independently by the
current HLSW92 Benchmark Chair Prof. Nikil Dutt from UC Irvine. The new 
benchmarks occupy less than 1000 Kbytes of disk space, combined. All designs
are described at the behavioral level in VHDL. Users should be able to compile
and simulate these VHDL files with any simulator compatible  with the VHDL
1076 standard. All designs represent a good mix of behavioral descriptions
with progressively complex control structures and data path components. The
first set of data points for these designs, synthesized at the register-,
the gate- and the transistor layout-level has been published in [1], while
the newer set of data points using the currently "frozen" descriptions of
benchmarks can be found in [2].

Each benchmark sub-directory contains an individual README file, explaining
the nature and content of each file included in that particular sub-directory.
