This directory contains the design files for the GCD chip.
The GCD chip returns the GCD of two numbers which are taken
as input. The algorithm used is a minor variant of Euclids
algorithm. It should be noted that there are multiple versions
of GCD and not all are the same. The HLSynth91 benchmark suite
has several descriptions of the GCD chip. Not all of them
are complete (as far as checking boundary conditions) unlike
this description. There is one description in the HLSynth91
suite which is complete. It is described in HardwareC language
whereas ours is described in VHDL. There is a VHDL description
of GCD in the benchmark suite HLSynth92. It is functionally
the same but the description differs from the one presented here.

A description of the files in this directory follows.

- "gcd.vhdl"
        contains the vhdl description of the function of the
        chip.

- "gcd_stim.vhdl"
        contains the vhdl description needed for (partial)
        simulation of the design.

- "waves.ps"
        contains the waveforms resulting from simulating the
        scheduled vhdl description. When the signal consists
        of a more than one bit, then the value (decimal) is indicated
        between parallel lines whenever possible. The file is
        in postscript.

- "gcd.io"
        this file is a more english like description of
        the inputs and the way the outputs change with
        the inputs. A ".I" indicates an input and a ".O"
        indicates an output. 

Additional information about this benchmark and a new data point at
register-, gate- and transistor-level for this design can be obtained from
