This directory contains the design files for the TRAFFIC chip.
The chip is a controller for traffic lights at a highway 
intersection with a farm road. There are two versions, the 
algo version and the hlsm version. The hlsm version
is a "lower" level version than the algo version.
A description similar to "highway_hlsm.vhdl" appears in
the HLSynth92 benchmark suite as the "tlc" chip. "highway_algo.vhdl"
is a higher level (algorithmic) version of the same chip.

A description of the files in the directory follows.

- "highway_algo.vhdl", "highway_hlsm.vhdl"
        contains the vhdl description of the function of the
        chip.

- "highway_stim.vhdl"
        contains the vhdl description needed for (partial)
        simulation of the design.

- "waves_algo.ps", "waves_hlsm.ps"
        contains the waveforms resulting from simulating the
        scheduled vhdl description. When the signal consists
        of a more than one bit, then the value (decimal) is indicated
        between parallel lines whenever possible. The file is
        in postscript.

- "highway_algo.io", "highway_hlsm.io"
        this file is a more english like description of
        the inputs and the way the outputs change with
        the inputs. A ".I" indicates an input and a ".O"
        indicates an output. It should be noted that in
        several places one has been asked "to iterate
        till ..." . Given the VHDL description without
        any IO constraints, one will come up with schedules
        which needs different number of clock ticks (time
        steps) to do the same sequence of operations. We have
        tried to impose the minimum amount of constraint by
        asking "to iterate till ...". We suggest one go
        through their implementation of the schedule till
        the outputs reach the values specified. If the
        specified values are not reached, there is a bug
        somewhere.

Additional information about this benchmark and a new data point at
register-, gate- and transistor-level for this design can be obtained from
