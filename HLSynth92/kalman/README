THIS DIRECTORY HAS THE FOLLOWING FILES :

( NOTE: These files, especially the test vectors, pertain to all three 
        sub-directories mentioned below. )

KALMAN.vhdl         :  This file contains the VHDL description of the kalman 
                       filter model.

kalman.doc          :  This file contains a brief description of the kalman
                       filter.

test_vectors_KALMAN.vhdl: This file contains the VHDL (translated) test vectors
		       for KALMAN. In order to simulate it on the Zycad 
                       ( Version 1.0a) simulator, the model is
		       instantiated in this file as a component. The test
		       vectors are statements inside a VHDL process.

test_vectors.doc    :  This is a documentation files on the test vectors,

cmd.inc             :  This is a command file used by the ZYCAD simulator 
                       ( Version 1.0a) while running the test vectors on any of
                       the models.

 RUNNING THE TEST VECTORS ON THE MODELS USING THE ZYCAD SIMULATOR:

******************************************************************************

 **** Running test_vectors on the whole chip ****

 For example, let us try to run the test vectors on the model contained in
 file "KALMAN.vhdl". This is a model of the whole chip.

    (i) Compile the Pre-defined Functions file by typing 
          " zvan pack_3.0.vhd"
   (ii) Compile the VHDL model file by typing 
          " zvan KALMAN.vhdl"
  (iii) Compile the VHDL test-vectors file by typing 
          " zvan test_vectors_KALMAN.vhdl"
  (iv)  Run the simulation typing 
           " zvsim -t ns -i cmd.inc E".
         
       The simulation output will appear in a file called "run.out".
       If there are any errors in simulation, "Assert" statements 
       will appear in this file, mentioning the port at which the 
       error occurred and the expected value.
