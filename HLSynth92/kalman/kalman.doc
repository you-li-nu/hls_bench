Functionality :
-----------------
The purpose of the Kalman filter is to predict the state vector of a system
from a set of observed quantities. The dimensionality of the state vector is
larger than that of the measurements. The imbalance is remedied by using 
many successive data observations in the prediction process.

The operation of the kalman filter chip is as follows:  First a set
of coefficent matrices is downloaded into the chip.  Once this is
completed, the chip enters its control loop.  Within this loop, four
steps are repeated indefinitely.  First, 13 measurements "y" are read
into the chip.  Second, the state vector "x" (of dimension 16) is
estimated.  This involves multiplication by a 16x16 matrix,
multiplication by a 16x13 matrix, and numerical integration using the
previous state estimate.  Third, the control output vector "v" (of
dimension 4) is computed from the state estimate.  This involves
multiplication by a 4x16 matrix.  Fourth, the control vector "v" is
output from the chip.

The kalman filter requires negative numbers to control its feedback. The
highest negative number is two to the fifteen. Also, coefficients below
unity are required to ensure that feedback does not cause the numbers 
to blow up. Hence, all inputs numbers have been multiplied by 1024, 
that is pitched 10 binary places above unity.
