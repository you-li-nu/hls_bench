Functionality :
-----------------

   Highway light is green normally. When there is a car on the side
road and the highway light has been on for 'timeoutL' time, the highway
light turns yellow. 'timeoutS' time after it has turned yellow,
the highway light turns red and the side road light turns green. 

If there are no cars on the side road or the side road light has been 
on for 'timeoutL' time the side road light turns yellow. 'timeoutS'
time after it has turned yellow, the side road light turns red and 
the highway road light turns green. 

I guess the above timer signals would be connected to some external 
timer circuit. The startIimer would start the external timer 
circuitry everytime the state changes. The TimeoutL and TimeoutS 
should originate from the external timer. Apparently, the model does 
not describe how this works. 

In this model, the highway light is green usually. When there 
is a car on the side road, the side road light is green till max 'timeoutL' 
time and then goes back to red irrespective of whether there are cars on the 
highway. Infact, the model never checks for cars on the highway. 
Thus, the highway has priority over the side road.
