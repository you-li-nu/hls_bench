To run on linux:
---------------

1. Edit set_env.csh and run.csh to point to your installation of Vivado.  If you have a C shell already set up for
   Vivado development (for example, "rdi make" works in it), you do not need to edit the scripts.

2. In a C Shell, do following:

   source set_env.csh
   ./run.csh



set_env.csh: CSH script to add appropriate dir to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
run.csh : CSH script to compile and run the example
testbench.cpp: An example C test bench

shared_library.h, xsi_loader.h, xsi_loader.cpp: Wrapper C++ classes to load an XSI-based shared library created for a design under test

adder.vhd adder.prj  : HDL files and compilation xsim PRJ file comprising an example design under test


To run on Windows:
-----------------
1> Set environment varibale PATH to <Vivado Installation Root>\tps\mingw\6.2.0\win64.o\nt\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib;<Vivado Installation Root>\lib\win64.o

2> set installation path varialble <install_root> in run.bat

3> run 'run.bat'

testbench.cpp: An example C test bench

shared_library.h, xsi_loader.h, xsi_loader.cpp: Wrapper C++ classes to load a XSI based shared librray created for a design under test

adder.vhd adder.prj  : HDL files and compilation xsim PRJ file comprising an example design under test
