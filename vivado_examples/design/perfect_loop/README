 * Effect of perfect and semi-perfect loop nests in AutoESL

Files Included in this Package

Running the Design (edit x_hls.tcl to run synthesis)
=================================================
autoesl -f run_hls.tcl

Both designs in the perfect and semi_perfect directories are functionally equivalent.

Expected Behavior
=================================================
semi_perfect directory
This directory contains a semi-perfect loop nest for the matrix multiplication. A semi-perfect
loop nest is defined as a loop nest where not all of the code is limited to the inner most
loop. For example, in this case there is code between the J_LOOP and K_LOOP to initialize
the value of temp and write the result. 

The issue with semi-perfect loops is that they limit the level of automatic loop flattening
in AutoESL. In this case the I_LOOP and J_LOOP are flattened but the K_LOOP remains as its
own control domain. This causes extra overhead in transitioning into and out of the K_LOOP. 
For this example,Vivado HLSdetermines a best case latency of 74 clock cycles.

perfect directory
This directory contains a perfect loop nest for the matrix multiplication. A perfect
loop nest is defined as a loop nest where all of the code is limited to the inner most
loop. 

For this example,Vivado HLScan automatically flatten the control domains between loops
I_LOOP, J_LOOP, and K_LOOP into a single control domain and reduce FSM overhead. The resulting
best case latency is 33 clock cycles, which is approximately a factor of 2 better than the 
semi-perfect implementation of this algorithm.
