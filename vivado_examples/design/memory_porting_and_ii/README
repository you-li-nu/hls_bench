Running the Design (edit x_hls.tcl to run synthesis)
=================================================
autoesl -f run_hls.tcl

Expected Behavior
=================================================
Solution 1:
In solution 1, a pipeline directive is applied to the J_LOOP to increase performance
and decrease latency. This has the effect of completely unrolling the K_LOOP.Vivado HLS
will schedule the new design and attemtp to achieve an II of 1 as specified by the
pipeline directive. For this case,Vivado HLSwill only achieve an II of 2 due to the effects
of memory porting on arrays a and b. 

The unrolling of the K_LOOP exposes 3 memory operations on both a and b to AutoESL. In order to
achieve and II of 1, all 3 operations should be able to occur on the same clock cycle. The 
problem is that the default memory model inVivado HLSassumes a maximum of 2 ports per memory
(exactly the same as a BRAM). This means that at least 2 clock cycles are needed to execute
all 3 memory operations on arrays a and b.

Solution 2:
Solution 2 achieves the II of 1 target specified in solution 1 by altering the physical
implementation of arrays a and b. This change is enforced by applying the reshape and 
partition pragmas on each array. 

The reshape of array a along dimension 2 has the effect of merging the columns of a into a 
single wide word. This leads to only 1 memory operation on a per clock cycle.

The partition of array b along dimension 1 has the effect of separating the rows of b
into independent memory banks. This has the effect of showingVivado HLSonly 1 memory operation
per memory bank of b.
