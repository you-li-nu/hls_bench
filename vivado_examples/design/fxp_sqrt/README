/*
 * Example code for template function that implements a fixed point square-
 * root algorithm for HLS.
 *
 * While the <math.h> (or <cmath>) square-root (sqrt(), sqrtf(), etc) are
 * supported for HLS, they are always implemented as floating point operations
 * and result in the instantiation of a CoreGen Floating Point Operator core
 * in the final RTL, regardless of the types passed.  This template function
 * can result in a more efficient implementation for fixed point (and integer)
 * data types while maintaining precision of results (see comments in 
 * fxp_sqrt.h for more details).
