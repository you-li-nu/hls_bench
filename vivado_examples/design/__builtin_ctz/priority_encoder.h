// These functions implement priority encoders (32-bit & 64-bit input versions)
// for HLS using the "count trailing zeros" GCC builtin functions, which are 
// supported and efficient for HLS.  These priority encoder functions return
// an 8-bit signed value that has the value of the (zero-based) index for the
// rightmost one digit in the input word; generally, the output of such an
// encoder is undefined when the input is zero; these implementation return
// -1 (0xFF) on zero input.
//
// Note that the "count leading zeros" (__builtin_clz[ll]()) functions are
// also supported.
