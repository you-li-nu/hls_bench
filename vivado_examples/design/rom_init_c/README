/*
 * Example code for a scaled-integer fixed-point Hamming window function.
 * This example is intended to demonstrates the recommended coding style
 * when an array should be implemented as a ROM.  The key guideline is that
 * the ROM's source (in the C code) array should be initialized by a sub-
 * function to the function that access (reads from) the array.  When the
 * array is properly inferred to be a ROM, the initialization function will
 * be optimized away during HLS.
